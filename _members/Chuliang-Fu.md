## Intro

- Chuliang Fu received his Ph.D. from the University of Virginia in 2023. His research focuses on predictive defect engineering for materials design, integrating theoretical modeling, computational simulation, and characterization methods. He is particularly interested in the mathematical structures underlying materials behavior, aiming to establish scalable principles to uncover and resolve the complexity of materials systems. During his Ph.D., he developed a cluster variation method under the FYL-transform and incorporated it into the framework of computational thermodynamics.

## Research Field

1. Computational thermodynamics and kinetics in electrochemistry and physical metallurgy
2. Transport phenomena and thermal management in battery and semiconductor systems
3. Analytical or data-driven computational methods for structural defects
4. Theoretical analysis of materials characterization
