## Intro

- Yilin Zhang, postdoctoral researcher at Peking University, with a Bachelor's and Ph.D. in Physics from Fudan University. My primary research focuses on the inverse design and property investigation of low-dimensional quantum materials. I employ multi-scale ab initio computational methods to explore the electronic structure, spin characteristics, and transport properties of two-dimensional materials. I have also been involved in the development of the multi-objective material inverse design software IM²ODE.

## Research Field

- The construction of databases and machine learning models for halide solid-state electrolytes
- Theoretical studies on the air degradation mechanisms of halide solid-state electrolytes.
